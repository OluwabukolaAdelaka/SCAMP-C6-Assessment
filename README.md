###### Reflection

This project is done for SCAMP-C6 Technical Assessment for Mentee Application.
It was an interesting project and the challenges I ran into was trying to build carousel for the mobile view and gallery with thumbnail for the desktop view which has helped me to learn and up my skill.

At the end, i was able to achieve my aim with the project, which i implemented with React, React hook, JSX, tailwindcss, React-icon, and Toastify. I chose to use create-react-app boilerplate to minimize the amount of setup and invest more time in the project.
