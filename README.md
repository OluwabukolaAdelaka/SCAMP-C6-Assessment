###### Reflection

This project is done for SCAMP-C6 Technical Assessment for Mentee Application.
It was an interesting project and a challenge i ran into was trying to build my own carousel for the mobile view which has helped me to learn and up my skill.

At the end, i was able to achieve my aim with the project which i implemented with React, React hook, JSX, tailwindcss, React-icon, Lightgallery and Toastify. I chose to use create-react-app boilerplate to minimize the amount of setup and invest more time in the project.
